# ect-mac-spoofer

This tool is used to get a random mac address, valid for connecting to "l'e-C Tablette" Wi-Fi networks with your mac.
##How to use:
It's very simple:
```
git clone https://github.com/marcfusch/ect-mac-spoofer/
cd ect-mac-spoofer
chmod 755 mac.sh
./mac.sh
```
You will just need to enter your root password in order to change the mac address.

Once the script closes, you just need to connect to the Wi-Fi network and log-in with your credentials.
